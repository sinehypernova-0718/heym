# JSON output mapper

The **JSON output mapper** node builds a JSON object from key/value [mappings](./set-node.md) (same model as [Set](./set-node.md)). Use it when callers should receive a **plain JSON body** at the root of the response.

## Overview

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Inputs | 1 |
| Outputs | 0 (sink) |
| Runtime output | Object built from `mappings` |

## Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| `label` | string | Node identifier (camelCase) |
| `mappings` | array | `{ "key": "fieldName", "value": "expression" }` entries (same as Set) |

## Agent tool usage

When JSON output mapper is connected to an [Agent Node](./agent-node.md) as a canvas node tool, mapping values can be marked as **agent-provided** with the bot icon. Marked values become required tool parameters supplied by the agent at runtime. Unmarked values remain fixed.

The bot icon appears only while the mapper is connected to an agent's tools handle.

## Webhook and run behavior

When this node is the **only** terminal output of the workflow, execution **outputs** are the mapped object itself: keys from `mappings` appear at the **top level** of the JSON. There is **no** outer wrapper keyed by the node label and **no** `{ "result": ... }` object (unlike the [Output](./output-node.md) node).

If multiple terminal nodes produce outputs (for example [Output](./output-node.md) plus JSON output mapper, or several branches), Heym uses the normal shape: each terminal is keyed by its `label`.

## Loop restriction

Same rule as [Output](./output-node.md): do not place this node inside a loop iteration branch—only after the loop `done` branch. See [Loop](./loop-node.md).

## Example

```json
{
  "type": "jsonOutputMapper",
  "data": {
    "label": "apiPayload",
    "mappings": [
      { "key": "message", "value": "$llm.text" },
      { "key": "ok", "value": "true" }
    ]
  }
}
```
